Long paragraph synopsis (200+ words)
No emotional hooks
Missing key genre/tone indicators
Unclear protagonist goal
```

**✅ AFTER (Optimized):**
```
HEADLINE: [Genre] story about [protagonist] who must [goal]

• [Act 1 setup - 1 sentence with emotional hook]
• [Act 2 conflict - 1 sentence with stakes]
• [Act 3 promise - 1 sentence with resolution tease]

VISUAL: Key image showing protagonist in signature moment

TONE: [Comparable 1] meets [Comparable 2]
```

**Why This Works Better:**
Investors spend 15 seconds per slide. Dense paragraphs get skipped. This format delivers story clarity instantly while maintaining emotional impact.
