## 📈 SAMPLE: VARIANCE ANALYSIS

**Here's an example of what our detailed variance analysis looks like:**

### Department Deep-Dive: Locations

```
🔴 LOCATIONS - VARIANCE ANALYSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Budgeted:              $67,500
Actual:                $81,700
Variance:              +$14,200 (21.0% over)
Severity:              🔴 HIGH ATTENTION REQUIRED

ROOT CAUSE BREAKDOWN:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Permit Revocation Emergency:        +$9,200 (65% of variance)
   • Lost warehouse permit 2 days before shoot
   • Emergency replacement cost 3x original
   • Affected: 5 shoot days

2. Extended Hours/Overtime:            +$3,400 (24% of variance)
   • Complex scenes ran over on 3 days
   • Location overtime fees triggered

3. Additional Security:                +$1,600 (11% of variance)
   • New city requirement for night shoots
   • Mandatory for 2 exterior locations

INDUSTRY CONTEXT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Location variances of 18-25% are common in indie productions
✓ Permit issues affect ~40% of urban shoots
✓ Your 21% variance is WITHIN NORMAL RANGE

PREVENTABILITY:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Preventable:     $3,400 (24%) - scene timing improvements
Uncontrollable:  $10,800 (76%) - regulatory/external factors

STAKEHOLDER TALKING POINTS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
"Location costs are 21% over budget primarily due to an 
unexpected permit revocation that required an emergency 
replacement location. This accounts for 65% of the variance 
and was completely outside our control. The remaining 24% 
was due to scene complexity, and we've implemented timing 
adjustments to prevent recurrence. This variance is within 
normal industry range for urban indie productions facing 
similar regulatory challenges."
```

**Full Version Includes:**
- Analysis for ALL departments
- Corrective actions already taken
- Lessons learned for future productions
- Detailed preventability assessment
- Complete industry benchmark comparison
